# fixedLang sets the language of the strings to the fixed language, this ensures that the formatter will always use the same language for its labels, strings, etc... no matter what language code is in the url.
#fixedLang=eng
# loadGeonetworkStrings - if true or non-existent then geonetwork strings will be added to the xml document before view.xsl is applied.  The default is true so if this parameter is not present then the strings will be loaded
loadGeonetworkStrings=true

# applicableSchemas - defines which metadata schemas this bundle applies to.  
# For example one can specify only iso19139 or a comma separated list of schemas (or all)
# applicableSchemas=iso19115,fgdc-std,iso19139,csw-record,iso19110
applicableSchemas=all

# dependsOn - defines which schema plugin's formatter folder is required to run the  
# current formatter.  For example iso19139.che depends on iso19139.  This means that the
# files in iso19139 are accessible by iso19139.che formatter.
dependsOn=iso19139

# published (true/false) - declares if the formatter should be part of public listing of the formatter.
published=true
