If a formatter requires localization that cannot be found in strings or schema 
localization the format bundle can have a loc subfolder containing translations.

The xml document created will have the xml files from loc/<currentLoc>/ added to
xml documentation under the /root/resources tag.

If a localization folder is not found then the default language will be used.  
if the default language also does not exist then the first localization will be used
but it is recommended to always have the default language localization
(unless language is fixed in the config.properties)
